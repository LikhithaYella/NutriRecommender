Learning Progress in Python and Machine Learning

1. Started learning Python basics including variables, data types, and control structures.
2. Explored fundamental concepts such as functions, loops, and conditional statements.
3. Dived into Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
4. Implemented various machine learning algorithms including linear regression, logistic regression, and decision trees.
5. Experimented with data preprocessing techniques such as scaling, encoding, and handling missing values.
6. Explored model evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
7. Practiced model selection and hyperparameter tuning using techniques like cross-validation and grid search.
8. Worked on real-world datasets to apply learned concepts and gain practical experience.
9. Engaged in coding challenges and exercises to reinforce understanding and problem-solving skills.
10. Continuously expanding knowledge through online courses, tutorials, and hands-on projects.
